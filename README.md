# Website Blocker

## Introduction
The Website Blocker is a Python-based utility that allows users to block access to specific websites during certain time periods. It achieves this by modifying the system's `hosts` file to redirect the specified websites to a loopback address (`127.0.0.1`). This can help improve productivity by restricting access to distracting websites like social media during work or study hours.

---

## How It Works
The program works by:
1. **Modifying the Hosts File**: 
   - The `hosts` file is a system configuration file that maps hostnames to IP addresses.
   - By adding entries that redirect specific websites to `127.0.0.1`, access to these websites is effectively blocked.

2. **Blocking Hours**:
   - Users can define specific hours during which the websites should remain blocked. Outside of these hours, the websites are unblocked automatically.

3. **Persistent Block List**:
   - The program saves the list of blocked websites in a JSON file (`blocked_websites.json`) so that it persists across sessions.

4. **Interactive Menu**:
   - The program provides a user-friendly menu to manage blocked websites, set blocking hours, and start/stop blocking.

- **Add Websites to Block**: Add new websites to the block list.
- **Set Blocking Hours**: Define specific hours during which websites should be blocked.

- **Unblock All Websites**: Remove all websites from the block list and restore access.

## Notes
1. **Permissions**:
   - The script requires write permissions to the `hosts` file. Make sure to run it with administrator/superuser privileges.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - The script supports both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS).

3. **Blocked Websites File**:
   - The list of blocked websites is saved in a file named `blocked_websites.json` in the same directory as the script. This ensures that the block list persists even after the script is closed.

4. **Stopping the Script**:
   - Use `Ctrl+C` to interrupt and stop the blocking process manually.
